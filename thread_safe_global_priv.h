/*
 * Design #1: Two slots.
 *
 * This design uses a pair of "slots", such that one holds the current value of
 * the thread-safe global variable, while the other holds the previous/next
 * value.
 *
 * Writers make the previous slot into the new current slot, being careful not
 * to step on the toes of a reader that was reading from that slot thinking it
 * was the current slot.
 *
 * Readers are lock-less, except that when a reader is the last reader of a
 * slot it has to signal a writer that might be waiting for that reader to be
 * done with the slot.  Also, readers do call free(), which may acquire locks.
 * Sending that signal requires taking a lock that the writer will have dropped
 * in order to wait, thus it should be an uncontended lock, and if the reader
 * blocks racing with a writer, it should unblock very soon after.  This is
 * never needed when the value has not changed since the previous read.
 *
 * Both, reading, and writing are O(1).

/*
 * Design #2: Value list + per-reader thread slots.
 *
 * This design uses a list of referenced values and a set of slots, one per
 * thread that has read this thread-safe global variable.
 *
 * Readers "subscribe" the first time they read a thread-safe global variable,
 * allocating a slot.  Thereafter readers are very fast, using two fenced
 * memory operations to get the newest value of the thread-safe global
 * variable.
 *
 * Writers add new values to the head of a linked list, then garbage collect
 * the list by visiting all the reader subscription slots to mark the list then
 * sweep it.
 *
 * Readers never ever block and never call into the allocator.  First time
 * readers are O(N), else they are O(1).  Compare to the two-slot design where
 * readers may block briefly but are always O(1).
 *
 * Writers are serialized but do not block while holding the lock.  Writers do
 * not call the allocator while holding the lock.  Writers are O(N).  Compare to
 * the two-slot design, where writers are O(1).
