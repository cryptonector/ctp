/*
 * The design for this implementation uses a pair of slots such that one
 * has a current value for the variable, and the other holds the
 * previous value and will hold the next value.
 *
 * There are several atomic compositions needed to make this work.
 *
 *  - writers have to write two things (a pointer to a struct wrapping
 *    the intended value, and a version number)
 *
 *  - readers have to atomically read a version number, a pointer, and
 *    increment a ref count.
 *
 * These compositions are the challenging part of this.
 *
 * In a way this structure is a lot like a read-write lock that doesn't
 * starve writers.  But since the only thing readers here do with a
 * would-be read-write lock held is grab a reference to a "current"
 * value, this construction can be faster than read-write locks without
 * writer starvation: readers (almost) *never* block on contended
 * resources.  We achieve this by having two value slots: one for the
 * current value, and one for the previous/next value.  Readers can
 * always lock-less-ly find one of the two values.
 *
 * Whereas in the case of a read-write lock without writer starvation,
 * readers arriving after a writer must get held up for the writer who,
 * in turn, is held up by readers.  Therefore, for the typical case
 * where one uses read-write locks (to mediate access to rarely-changing
 * mostly-read-only data, typically configuration data), the API
 * implemented here is superior to read-write locks.
 *
 * We often use atomic CAS with equal new and old values as an atomic
 * read.  We could do better though.  We could use a LoadStore fence
 * around reads instead.
 *
 * NOTE WELL: We assume that atomic operations imply memory barriers.
 *
 *            The general rule is that all things which are to be
 *            atomically modified in some cases are always modified
 *            atomically, except at initialization time, and even then,
 *            in some cases the initialized value is immediately
 *            modified with an atomic operation.  This is to ensure
 *            memory visibility rules (see above), though we may be
 *            trying much too hard in some cases.
 *
 *            The atomic operations from atomics.[ch] provide the necessary
 *            barriers.

/*
 * This design uses a pair of "slots", such that one holds the current value of
 * the thread-safe global variable, while the other holds the previous/next
 * value.
 *
 * Writers make the previous slot into the new current slot, being careful not
 * to step on the toes of a reader that was reading from that slot thinking it
 * was the current slot.
 *
 * Readers are lock-less, except that when a reader is the last reader of a
 * slot it has to signal a writer that might be waiting for that reader to be
 * done with the slot.  Also, readers do call free(), which may acquire locks.
 * Sending that signal requires taking a lock that the writer will have dropped
 * in order to wait, thus it should be an uncontended lock, and if the reader
 * blocks racing with a writer, it should unblock very soon after.  This is
 * never needed when the value has not changed since the previous read.
 *
 * Both, reading, and writing are O(1).

 * things written to by the writer; all readers "subscribe" and thence
 * their state consists of a single pointer to what was at read-time the
 * head of that linked list, with that pointer held where the writers
 * can find it (in "subscription" slots) so they can garbage collect in
 * order to release no-longer referenced values.
 *
 * Subscription is lock-less.  There's an index into a logical array of
 * subscription slots.  New reader threads increment a counter to
 * determine their index into this array.  If the array index goes past
 * the allocated array size, then the array is grown lock-less-ly.  The
 * array is maintained as a linked list of array chunks; when a reader
 * goes to grow it, it will either win a race to grow it or lose it,
 * using an atomic CAS operation to perform the growth; losers free
 * their chunk and then look for their slot in the winner's chunk and
 * possibly retry the array growth operation.
 *
 * Once subcribed, readers only ever do an acquire-fenced read on the
 * head of the linked list of values, and write that to their slot with
 * a release-fenced write.
 *
 * Writers only add new values at the head of the list, with the
 * previous head as the next pointer of the new element.
 *
 * Writers also mark-and-sweep garbage collect the extant value list by
 * reading every subscribed thread's pointer with an acquire-fenced
 * read, marking all in-use values as such, then the writer releases and
 * removes from the list those elements not marked as in-used.  Readers
 * never read the next pointers of the list's elements.
 *
 * Readers do two fenced memory operations.  Writers do N fenced memory
 * operations plus the writer lock acquire/release and any locks
 * required to allocate and free list elements.  Readers may have to
 * allocate the first time they read, but not thereafter.
 */

/*
 * Design #2: Value list + per-reader thread slots.
 *
 * This design uses a list of referenced values and a set of slots, one per
 * thread that has read this thread-safe global variable.
 *
 * Readers "subscribe" the first time they read a thread-safe global variable,
 * allocating a slot.  Thereafter readers are very fast, using two fenced
 * memory operations to get the newest value of the thread-safe global
 * variable.
 *
 * Writers add new values to the head of a linked list, then garbage collect
 * the list by visiting all the reader subscription slots to mark the list then
 * sweep it.
 *
 * Readers never ever block and never call into the allocator.  First time
 * readers are O(N), else they are O(1).  Compare to the two-slot design where
 * readers may block briefly but are always O(1).
 *
 * Writers are serialized but do not block while holding the lock.  Writers do
 * not call the allocator while holding the lock.  Writers are O(N).  Compare to
 * the two-slot design, where writers are O(1).
